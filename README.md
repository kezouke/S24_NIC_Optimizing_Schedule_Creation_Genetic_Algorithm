# Optimizing Schedule Creation with Genetic Algorithm

This project aims to optimize schedule creation using a genetic algorithm approach. The main focus is on solving the  ["Santa's Workshop Tour 2019"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-workshop-tour-2019) scheduling problem, which entails efficiently scheduling visits for 5000 families to Santa's workshop over a 100-day period. By leveraging genetic algorithms, the project seeks to find optimal solutions that balance individual preferences with global operational constraints. The genetic algorithm adapts and evolves solutions through mechanisms such as mutation, crossover, and selection, offering a robust approach to address complex scheduling challenges. The implementation of the genetic algorithm can be found in the main file `main.ipynb`.
